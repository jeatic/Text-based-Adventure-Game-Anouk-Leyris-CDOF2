# Text-based-Adventure-Game-Anouk-Leyris-CDOF2

A text-based adventure game where the player's decisions define the outcome of the story.

## Getting Started

# Add other libraries if needed

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/anoukleyris/Text-based-Adventure-Game-Anouk-Leyris-CDOF2.git

# Prerequisites (for those who want help me)

Before making any changes, create a fork and a branch with the issue you resolve where you will modify the code without touching my main branch. 

## Running the Tests
Before running the tests, ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
pip install colorama playsound
Open the code project.py with Visual Studio Code for example
Launch the code using the "Run" command or in entering "run project.py" in a terminal and start playing!

### Break Down into End-to-End Tests

The game will end when the story is complete.
